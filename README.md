# Misplaced Deagles
Misplaced Deagles is a website inspired by [misplaceditems.com](https://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/?display=avg&interval=qtr_hr&total=1), which compares the populations of two similar and frequently compared games: Old School RuneScape (OSRS) and RuneScape3 (RS3). Misplaced Deagles performs a similar function but for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) and Valorant.
